# FeatureflowClient
### What is this?
This is the returned client instance returned from [`Featureflow.init(...)`](./1.Featureflow.md). 
It contains the [`Features`](./objects/Feature.md) for the apiKey's environment.

Once instantiated, you should assume that the user will reference this instance for the lifetime of their application.

For the purpose of this document, assume that `featureflow` is the instantiated client from `Featureflow.init(...)`.

### Constructor
#### `new featureflow(apiKey, [config])`
When instantiating the `featureflow` client you should perform the following:
- Create a local [`PollingClient`](./6.PollingClient.md) service instance with the apiKey
- Create a local [`FeatureflowEvents`](./7.FeatureflowEvents.md) service instance with the apiKey
  - Send a featureflow event to `register` the features in `config.withFeatures`

### Interface
#### `featureflow.evaluate(featureKey, [context])`
- Returns: an instantiated [`Evaluate`](./3.Evaluate.md) object
- Arguments:
  - `featureKey*` The key of the feature to evaluate
  - `context` The current context of the request (if applicable) -> [See Context](./objects/Context.md)
  
#### Up Next: [3. Evaluate](./3.Evaluate.md)
