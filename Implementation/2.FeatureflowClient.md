#FeatureflowClient
###What is this?
This is the returned client instance returned from [`Featureflow.init(...)`](./1.Featureflow.md). 
It contains the features rules for the apiKey's environment.

Once instantiated, you should assume that the user will reference this instance for the lifetime of their application.

For the purpose of this document, assume that `featureflow` is the instantiated client from `Featureflow.init(...)`.

###Constructor
####`new featureflow(apiKey, [config])`
When instantiating the `featureflow` client you should perform the following:
- Create a local StreamingClient service instance with the apiKey -> [See StreamingClient](./x.StreamingClient.md)
- Create a local FeatureflowEvents service instance with the apiKey -> [See FeatureflowEvents](./x.FeatureflowEvents.md)
  - Send a featureflow event to `register` the features in `config.withFeatures`

###Interface
####`featureflow.evaluate(featureKey, [context])`
- Returns: an instantiated `Evaluate` object -> [See Evaluate](./3.Evaluate.md)
- Arguments:
  - `featureKey*` The key of the feature to evaluate
  - `context` The current context of the request (if applicable) -> [See Context](./x.Context.md)
