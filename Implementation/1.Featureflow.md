#1. Featureflow
###What is this?
This is the exposed static module of the Featureflow SDK. 
Its purpose is to initialise and return (asynchronously) an instantiated Featureflow instance for the given api key and configuration options.

###Interface
####`Featureflow.init(apiKey, [config])`
- Returns: the instantiated FeatureflowClient -> [See FeatureflowClient](./2.FeatureflowClient.md)
- Arguments:
  - `apiKey*` The api key for the environment the client is connecting to.
  - `config` An optional map containing extra information
    - `withFeatures = []` A list of features to register with featureflow on application startup -> [See FeatureRegistration](./x.FeatureRegistration.md)

Essentially you will be calling `featureflow = new FeatureflowClient(apiKey, config)` 
under the hood and returning `featureflow` when it has initialised.

#####Example Implementation
```python
# Sychronous Python example
from Featureflow import Featureflow
try:
  featureflow = Feature.init(apiKey, config)
  # featureflow contains the fully instantiated client
except:
  print "Error 
```
If asynchronous the client should be returned via async/await, callback, promise, event, ...etc
```javascript
//Asynchronous NodeJS example
const Featureflow = require('featureflow-node-sdk');
Featureflow.init(apiKey, config, callback);

function callback(err, featureflow){
  if (err){
    console.log('Error instantiating client')
  }
  // featureflow contains the fully instantiated client
}
```
