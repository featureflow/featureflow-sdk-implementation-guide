# 1. Featureflow
### What is this?
This is the exposed singleton Featureflow SDK. 
Its purpose is to initialise and return an instantiated `Featureflow` client instance for the given `apiKey` and `config`.

### Interface
#### `Featureflow.init(apiKey, [config])`
- Returns: the instantiated [`FeatureflowClient`](./2.FeatureflowClient.md)
- Arguments:
  - `apiKey*` The api key for the environment the client is connecting to.
  - `config` An optional map containing extra information
    - `withFeatures = []` A list of [`FeatureRegistrations`](./objects/FeatureRegistration.md) to register with **featureflow.io** on startup

Essentially you will be calling `featureflow = new FeatureflowClient(apiKey, config)` 
under the hood and returning `featureflow` when it has initialised.

##### Example Implementation
```python
# Sychronous Ruby example
require 'featureflow'
api_key = 'srv-env-...'
client = Featureflow::Client.new apiKey
```
If asynchronous the client should be returned via async/await, callback, promise, event, ...etc
```javascript
//Asynchronous NodeJS example
const Featureflow = require('featureflow-node-sdk');
Featureflow.init(apiKey, config, callback);

function callback(err, featureflow){
  if (err){
    console.log('Error instantiating client')
  }
  // featureflow contains the fully instantiated client
}
```
