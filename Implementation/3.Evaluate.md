# Evaluate
### What is this?
The `Evaluate` instance is used primarily to test a specific [`Feature`](./objects/Feature.md), for a particular [`Context`](./objects/Context.md), 
evaluates to a specific `variantKey` (usually `'on'` or `'off'`).
 
Its main usage expects a `boolean` returned, an example being: 
```
if ( featureflow.evaluate(featureKey, context).is(variant) ){
  ...Do some feature specific code for the targeted variant here...
}
``` 

It calculates this value by finding the correct `variant` for the `feature` specified by the `featureKey`
 and `Context` provided (optional).
### Constructor
#### `new Evaluate(feature, [context])`
The `Evaluate` class can only be instantiated by the [`FeatureflowClient`]('./2.FeatureflowClient.md) calling `featureflow.evaluate(key, [context])`.

See [`Feature`](./objects/Feature.md) to see the structure of a feature.

During construction, `this.evaluatedVariant` should be set to the result of `_calculateVariant(feature, defaultFeatureVariant, context)`

#### `_calculateVariant(feature, context)`
- Returns: a `string` containing the evaluated `Variant`
- Arguments: 
  - `feature` the feature to calculate
  - `defaultFeatureVariant` the failover variant specified in the [`FeatureRegistration`](./objects/FeatureRegistration.md) for the Feature key
  - `context` from `context` -> should have default properties added to it. See [`Context`](./objects/Context.md) for more details
  
Example implementation is as follows:
```
# arguments: [feature, defaultFeatureVariant, context]

if (feature is defined) then
  if (feature.enabled is false) then
      return feature.offVariantKey
  endif
  
  foreach (rule in feature.rules) do
      # there is always a default rule so a value will always be returned
      if (EvaluateHelpers.ruleHasMatched(rule, context) == true) then
          hash = EvaluateHelpers.calculateHash(feature.variationSalt, feature.key, context.key)
          variantValue = Helpers.getVariantValue(hash)
          return EvaluateHelpers.getVariantSplitKey(rule.variantSplits, variantValue) 
      endif
  done
else
    if (defaultFeatureVariant is defined) then
        return defaultFeatureVariant
    else
        return 'off'
    endif
endif
``` 

### Interface
#### `featureflow.evaluate(...).is(variant)`
- Returns: a `boolean` if the `featureKey` matches the `variant` provided
- Arguments:
  - `variant*` The value of the variant you are testing (e.g. `'on'` or `'off'`)
  
Example implementation:
```
# arguments: [variant]
# from new Evaluate(...): [this.featureKey, this.context]

evaluated = this.value() # see .value() below
sendEvaluateEvent(this.featureKey, variant, evaluated, this.context) # Send an event to featureflow.io with the expected and evaluated feature for the context
return value == evaluated
```

You might also consider implementing some helper functions for the default `Variant` cases:
```
featureflow.evaluate(...).isOn()   # equivalent to featureflow.evaluate(...).is('on')
featureflow.evaluate(...).isOff()  # equivalent to featureflow.evaluate(...).is('off')
```
  
  
#### `featureflow.evaluate(...).value()`
- Returns: a `string` containing the evaluated `Variant` from `this.evaluatedVaraint`
