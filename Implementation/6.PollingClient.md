# PollingClient
### What is it?
Creates a timed poll to Featureflow to receive feature updates as opposed to the EventStreamClient which holds a SSE (Server Sent Event) Stream open.

### Setting up the connection
Perform a GET request to the following endpoint:
 - Connect to: `https://app.featureflow.io/api/sdk/v1/features`
    - allow this to be configurable in your api
 - Set the header `Authorization: bearer <token>`
    - token is the server api token in the format `sdk-srv-env-2adb6..<hash>`
 - Provide a header to identify the client and version (for example X-Featureflow-Client: JavaClient/1.0.0)
 - Poll this endpoint every 30 seconds, and update the feature cache in your [FeatureflowClient](./2.FeatureflowClient.md)

### Receiving Data

Each request to the featureflow server will return the current features. 
The features will be returned with the current format.

```javascript

data = JSON.parse(response.body);
data == {
  "example-feature": {/* ...feature... */},
  "example-feature-2": {/* ...feature... */}
}
```

### Cached responses

In order to limit the amount of data transmitted, Featureflow implements strong ETags (as per RFC 7232). 
The sdk should handle this to restrict writes to feature to only necessary ones.
The flow is as follows:

```
set self.etag = null
# start polling
async_loop
    request = http.request("https://app.featureflow.io/api/sdk/v1/features")
    request.setMethod('GET')
    request.addHeader("Authorization","srv-env-<hash>")
    request.addHeader("If-None-Match", self.etag)
    
    response = request.send()
      
    if (response.status == 200)
      self.etag = response.getHeader("ETag")
      json = JSON.parse(response.body)
      FeatureflowClient.updateFeatures(json)
    elseif (response.status >= 400)
      # handle error gracefully, log error
    endif
    sleep 30 seconds
  end
end
```
