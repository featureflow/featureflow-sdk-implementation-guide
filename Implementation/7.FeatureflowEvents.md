# FeatureflowEvents
### What is it?
Used to send events to **featureflow.io**.

#### Evaluate Event - `POST https://events.featureflow.io/api/sdk/v1/events`
When a feature has been evaluated, an event should be sent to **featureflow.io**. 
This is used to track feature usage statistics and help .

The event should contain the SDK information in the form of a User-Agent header -  e.g:
User-Agent : NodeJs/1.0.0

Example request:
```json
{
  "method": "POST",
  "url": "https://app.featureflow.io/api/sdk/v1/events",
  "json": [
     {
       "featureKey": "string",
       "evaluatedVariant": "string",
       "expectedVariant": "string",
       "user": {
          "id": "string",
          "attributes": {
            "key1": "value",
            "key2": ["value1","value2"]
          }
        }
     }
  ],
  "headers": {
    "Authorization": "Bearer <apiKey>",
    "User-Agent": "NodeJs/<version>",
    "content-type": "applcation/json"
  }
}
```

#### Feature Registration - `PUT https://events.featureflow.io/api/sdk/v1/register`
On startup, and if provided, featureRegistrations should be sent to **featureflow.io**. 
This will help register features in the backend without the need to create them in **<your-domain>.featureflow.io**.

See [`FeatureRegistration`](./objects/FeatureRegistration.md) for more information about the FeatureRegistration object. 

Example request:
```json
{
  "method": "PUT",
  "url": "https://app.featureflow.io/api/sdk/v1/register",
  "json": [
    {
      "key": "string",
      "failoverVariant": "string",
      "variants": [
        {
          "key":"string",
          "name": "string"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "headers": {
    "Authorization": "Bearer <apiKey>",
    "User-Agent": "NodeJs:<version>"    
  }
}
```
