**Audience** is a list of **Operators** that all must return `true` for it to return `true`, otherwise it will return `false`
##Functionality
The algorithm to implement the Audience is as follows:

##Tests to write
* Test all operators returning `true`, returning `true`
* Test one operator returning `false`, returning `false`
